                I developed an interest in photography during my time at university,
                when I attempted Project 365 with a Ricoh R8 system camera. I didn't
                make it to the end of the year, but I think my 182 days was a reasonable
                effort and it definitely helped me to find themes and compositions that
                work for me.

                I've continued shooting on and off ever since, now using a Nikon D7100
                with a variety of second hand lenses. My preferred subjects are mostly
                architecture, landscapes (natural and human-influenced), wildlife, and
                perhaps especially the intersections of those categories.

                I'm strictly an amateur and don't aim to produce work of a commercial 
                standard, but I'm very happy with some of the shots I have taken. A few
                of my favourites are shown in the gallery on this page, additional 
                examples can be seen on the other pages in this category.
