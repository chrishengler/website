                I developed an interest in photography during my time at university,
                and have continued to shoot as a hobby on-and-off ever since. My 
                preferred subjects are mostly architecture, landscapes (natural and
                human-influenced), wildlife, and perhaps especially the intersections 
                of those categories.

                I'm strictly an amateur and don't aim to produce work of a commercial 
                standard, but I'm very happy with some of the shots I have taken. A few
                of my favourites are shown in the gallery on this page, additional 
                examples can be seen on the other pages in this category.
