                I think all kinds of architecture have something to offer, from traditional 
                styles through brutalist apartment blocks and modern glass high-rise offices.

                This is the only section where I've dug up old photos from my time at university.
                The reason being that when putting this website together, I realised my eye for
                composition in architecture photos was much better 15 years ago than it is today. 
                I'll have to work on that.
